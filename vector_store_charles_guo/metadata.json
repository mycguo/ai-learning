It serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional Python package management tools like pip, offering significant improvements in speed, reliability, and dependency resolution.\nThis tool represents a new generation of Python package managers, designed to address common pain points in the Python ecosystem such as slow installation times, dependency conflicts, and environment management complexity. UV achieves this through its innovative architecture and efficient implementation, making it 10-100 times faster than traditional package managers.\nKey features that make UV stand out:\n\nLightning-fast package installation and dependency resolution\nCompatible with existing Python tools and workflows\nBuilt-in virtual environment management\nSupport for modern packaging standards\nReliable dependency locking and reproducible environments\nMemory-efficient operation, especially for large projects\n\nWhether working on small personal projects or managing large-scale Python applications, UV provides a robust and efficient solution for package management. In this tutorial, we will cover all essential aspects of UV so you can start using it immediately.\nThe Difference Among UV, Poetry, PIP, Conda, and virtualenv\nThe first question developers often ask before switching to a new tool is \"How does it compare to the one I am already using?\". In the Python dependency and project management arena, these four tools are already the most common:\n\nPIP\nPoetry\nConda\nvirtualenv\n\nLet's compare UV with each of these tools to help you decide if UV is the right choice for your needs before diving into the details.\nUV vs. PIP and virtualenv\nPIP and virtualenv have been the traditional tools for Python package management and virtual environment creation. While they get the job done, UV offers several compelling advantages:\n\nSpeed: UV's Rust implementation makes it significantly faster than PIP for package installation and dependency resolution, often completing tasks in seconds that would take PIP minutes.\nIntegrated environment management: While virtualenv handles only environment creation and PIP only handles package management, UV combines both functionalities in a single tool, streamlining the workflow.\n\nUV maintains full compatibility with PIP's ecosystem while addressing its key limitations. It can use the same requirements.txt files and package indexes, making migration seamless. The key differences are:\n\nPerformance: UV's parallel downloads and optimized dependency resolver make it 10-100x faster than PIP for large projects.\nMemory usage: UV uses significantly less memory than PIP during package installation and dependency resolution.\nError handling: UV provides clearer error messages and better conflict resolution when dependencies clash.\nReproducibility: UV's lockfile approach ensures consistent environments across different systems, something not guaranteed with basic requirements.txt files.\n\nWhile PIP and virtualenv remain viable options, UV's modern architecture and combined functionality make it an attractive alternative for developers seeking better performance and a more streamlined workflow. The ability to drop UV into existing projects without disrupting established processes makes it particularly appealing for teams looking to gradually modernize their Python development toolchain.\nUV vs. Conda\nPeople who don't use PIP and virtualenv usually turn to Conda and they have good reasons:",

The ability to drop UV into existing projects without disrupting established processes makes it particularly appealing for teams looking to gradually modernize their Python development toolchain.\nUV vs. Conda\nPeople who don't use PIP and virtualenv usually turn to Conda and they have good reasons:\n\nConda provides a complete package management solution that handles not just Python packages but also system-level dependencies\nIt excels at managing complex scientific computing environments with packages like NumPy, SciPy, and TensorFlow\nConda environments are more isolated and reproducible across different operating systems\nIt has built-in support for different Python versions and can switch between them easily\nThe Anaconda distribution comes with many pre-installed scientific packages, making it convenient for data scientists\n\nBut even hardcore Conda users should consider switching to UV for a variety of reasons. UV's lightning-fast package installation and dependency resolution can dramatically speed up environment setup compared to Conda's sometimes sluggish performance. Its minimal resource footprint means less memory usage and quicker startups. UV also integrates seamlessly with existing Python packaging standards and tools, making it easier to work with the broader Python ecosystem. For projects that don't require Conda's non-Python package management, UV provides a more streamlined, efficient solution that can significantly improve development workflows.\nUV vs. Poetry\nI was a Conda user for almost three years but after trying out Poetry a couple of times, I never touched turtle-speed Conda again. Just when I was getting comfortable with Poetry, I came across UV and it seems to promise nearly the same things as Poetry:\n\nDependency management: Both tools handle package dependencies and virtual environments effectively\nProject structure: Both provide tools for initializing and structuring Python projects\nLock files: Both generate lock files to ensure reproducible environments\nPackage publishing: Both support publishing packages to PyPI\nModern tooling: Both represent modern approaches to Python project management\n\nHowever, the defining feature of UV is its blazing-fast speed and minimal resource usage. While Poetry is a significant improvement over traditional tools, UV takes performance to another level because of its Rust implementation. Also, UV's compatibility with existing Python packaging means it can work alongside other tools like pip, offering flexibility that Poetry's more opinionated approach sometimes lacks.\nHere is a table summarizing the differences we've just covered: \n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n\nUV\n\n\nPIP + virtualenv\n\n\nConda\n\n\nPoetry\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nRust\n\n\nPython\n\n\nPython\n\n\nPython\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\n10-100x faster than pip\n\n\nBaseline\n\n\nSlower than pip\n\n\nFaster than pip\n\n\n\n\nMemory Usage\n\n\nVery efficient\n\n\nHigher\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nModerate\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Management\n\n\nBuilt-in\n\n\nSeparate tools needed\n\n\nBuilt-in\n\n\nBuilt-in\n\n\n\n\nDependency Resolution\n\n\nFast, modern resolver\n\n\nBasic\n\n\nComprehensive\n\n\nModern resolver\n\n\n\n\nNon-Python Packages\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nLock Files\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo (basic requirements.txt)\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nProject Structure\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nPackage Publishing\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes (with twine)\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nCompatibility\n\n\nWorks with existing pip ecosystem\n\n\nStandard Python tool\n\n\nOwn ecosystem\n\n\nMore opinionated approach\n\n\n\n\nError Handling\n\n\nClear error messages\n\n\nBasic\n\n\nGood\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n\nResource Footprint\n\n\nMinimal\n\n\nModerate\n\n\nHeavy\n\n\nModerate\n\n\n\n\nScientific Computing Focus\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nCross-platform Consistency\n\n\nYes\n\n\nLimited\n\n\nExcellent\n\n\nGood",

    "text": "If you think UV is worth switching, then read on.\nGetting Started With UV For Python Projects\nIn this section, we cover how to start a project from scratch using UV. We will discuss how to migrate from existing projects to UV in a later section.\nInstalling UV\nUV can be installed system-wide using cURL on macOS and Linux:\n$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sudo sh\nAnd with Powershell on Windows (make sure you run Powershell with administrator privileges):\n$ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\nUV is available via Homebrew as well:\n$ brew install uv\nA PIP install is supported but it is not recommended:\n$ pip install uv  # Make sure you have a virtual environment activated\nAfterward, you can verify the installation by running uv version:\n$ uv version\nuv 0.4.25 (97eb6ab4a 2024-10-21)\nInitializing a new project\nWorking on projects is the core part of the UV experience. You start by initializing an empty project using the uv init command:\n$ uv init explore-uv\nInitialized project explore-uv at /Users/bexgboost/projects/explore-uv\nThe command will immediately create a new explore-uv directory with the following contents:\n$ cd explore-uv\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── .gitignore\n├── .python-version\n├── README.md\n├── hello.py\n└── pyproject.toml\nGit is automatically initialized and main git-related files like .gitignore and an empty README.md are generated. .python-version file contains the Python version used for the project, while pyproject.toml serves as the main configuration file for project metadata and dependencies. A sample hello.py file is also created to help you get started quickly.\nYou can learn more about creating projects from the UV documentation.\nAdding initial dependencies to the project\nUV combines the environment creation and dependency installation into a single command - uv add:\n$ uv add scikit-learn xgboost\nUsing CPython 3.9.20 interpreter at: /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.9\nCreating virtual environment at: .venv\nResolved 6 packages in 1.78s\n⠧ Preparing packages... (2/5)\nPrepared 5 packages in 1m 23s\nInstalled 5 packages in 45ms\n + joblib==1.4.2\n + numpy==2.0.2\n + scikit-learn==1.5.2\n ...\nThe first time you run the add command, UV creates a new virtual environment in the current working directory and installs the specified dependencies. On subsequent runs, UV will reuse the existing virtual environment and only install or update the newly requested packages, ensuring efficient dependency management.\nAnother important process that happens for every add command is resolving dependencies. UV uses a modern dependency resolver that analyzes the entire dependency graph to find a compatible set of package versions that satisfy all requirements. This helps prevent version conflicts and ensures reproducible environments. The resolver considers factors like version constraints, Python version compatibility, and platform-specific requirements to determine the optimal set of packages to install.\nUV also updates the pyproject.toml and uv.lock files after each add command. Here is what the TOML file looks like after installing Scikit-learn and XGBoost:\n$ cat pyproject.toml\n[project]\nname = \"explore-uv\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"Add your description here\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \">=3.9\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"scikit-learn>=1.5.2\",\n    \"xgboost>=2.0.3\",\n]\nTo remove a dependency from the environment and the pyproject.toml file, you can use the uv remove command. It will uninstall the package and all its child-dependencies:\n$ uv remove scikit-learn\nWe will discuss dependency management in more detail in a later section.\nRunning Python scripts with UV\nOnce you install the necessary dependencies, you can start working on your Python scripts as usual. UV provides a few different ways to run Python code:\nTo run a Python script directly, you can use the uv run command followed by your script name instead of the usual python script.py syntax:\n$ uv run hello.py\nThe run command ensures that the script is executed inside the virtual environment UV created for the project. \nManaging Python Versions in UV\nManaging Python versions is a key part of dependency management. UV provides simple commands to control which Python version you use. Let's explore how to use the uv python command.\nListing existing Python versions\nSince it is common for systems to have Python already installed, UV can discover these existing installations by default. For example, to list all the Python versions UV detects on your system, run the following command:\n$ uv python list --only-installed\ncpython-3.13.0-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.13 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3.13\ncpython-3.12.7-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.12 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3.12",

UV provides simple commands to control which Python version you use. Let's explore how to use the uv python command.\nListing existing Python versions\nSince it is common for systems to have Python already installed, UV can discover these existing installations by default. For example, to list all the Python versions UV detects on your system, run the following command:\n$ uv python list --only-installed\ncpython-3.13.0-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.13 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/python3.13\ncpython-3.12.7-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.12 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3.12\ncpython-3.12.5-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/bexgboost/miniforge3/bin/python3.12\ncpython-3.12.5-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/bexgboost/miniforge3/bin/python3 -> python3.12\ncpython-3.12.5-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/bexgboost/miniforge3/bin/python -> python3.12\ncpython-3.11.10-macos-aarch64-none    /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.11 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11\ncpython-3.11.7-macos-aarch64-none     /Users/bexgboost/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.11.7-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3 -> python3.11\ncpython-3.10.15-macos-aarch64-none    /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.10 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin/python3.10\ncpython-3.9.20-macos-aarch64-none     /opt/homebrew/opt/[email protected]/bin/python3.9 -> ../Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3.9\ncpython-3.9.6-macos-aarch64-none      /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3 -> ../../Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3\nThe command correctly detected my Conda and Brew-installed Python versions.\nChanging Python versions for the current project \nYou can switch Python versions for your current UV project at any point as long as the new version satisfies the specifications in your pyproject.toml file. For example, the following file requires Python versions 3.9 and above:\n...\nrequires-python = \">=3.9\"\nThis means you can change the Python version in .python-version file to any version above, like 3.11.7. Afterwards, call uv sync.\nThe command first checks against existing Python installations. If the requested version isn't found, UV downloads and installs it inside the /Users/username/.local/share/uv/python path. UV also creates a new virtual environment inside the project directory, replacing the old one. \nThis new environment doesn't have the dependencies listed in your pyproject.toml file, so you have to install them with the following command:\n$ uv pip install -e .\nNote that sometimes uv commands may raise Permission Denied errors. In those cases, be sure to use the sudo command if you are on macOS or Linux or run your command prompt with administrator privileges if you are on Windows. Even better solution would be to change the ownership of the UV home directory to the user:\n$ sudo chown -R $USER ~/.local/share/uv  # macOS or Linux\nTo learn more about managing Python versions with UV, refer to the documentation. \nWhat Are UV Tools And How to Use Them?\nSome Python packages are exposed as command-line tools like black for code formatting, flake8 for linting, pytest for testing, mypy for type checking, etc. UV provides two special interfaces to manage these packages:\n1. Using uv tool run:\n$ uv tool run black hello.py\n2. Using the shorter and more convenient uvx command:\n$ uvx black hello.py\nWhen these commands are run, UV creates a temporary virtual environment in its cache. The requested tool is installed and run from there. In other words, you can use command-line tools without installing them in the project's virtual environment, resulting in faster execution and cleaner project dependencies.\nKey points about the tool run interfaces:",

When you run uv add commands to install dependencies, UV automatically generates and updates a uv.lock file. This lock file serves several critical purposes:\n\nIt records the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies that were installed.\nIt ensures reproducible builds by \"locking\" dependency versions across different environments.\nIt helps prevent \"dependency hell\" by maintaining consistent package versions.\nIt speeds up installations since UV can use the locked versions instead of resolving dependencies again.",

    "text": "UV manages the lock file automatically - you don't need to manually edit it. The lock file should be committed to version control to ensure all developers use the same dependency versions.\nThe Difference Between Lock Files and requirements.txt\nWhile both lock files and requirements.txt serve to track dependencies, they have distinct purposes and use cases. Lock files contain detailed information about exact package versions and their complete dependency tree, ensuring consistent environments across development. Requirements.txt files are simpler, typically listing only direct dependencies, and are widely supported across Python tools.\nLock files are essential for development to maintain reproducible builds and prevent dependency conflicts. Requirements.txt files are better suited for deployment scenarios or when sharing code with users who may not use UV. They're also necessary for compatibility with tools and services that don't support UV's lock file format.\nYou can maintain both files by using UV's lock file for development while generating a requirements.txt for deployment. To generate a requirements.txt from a UV lock file, use the following command:\n$ uv export -o requirements.txt\nThis creates the text file with pinned versions based on your lock file, making it easy to share your project's dependencies in a standard format while still benefiting from UV's advanced dependency management during development.\nYou can learn more about managing lock files from the documentation. \nAdvanced Dependency Management With UV\nIn this section, we will explore more sophisticated methods to manage dependencies in UV. We will learn how to update dependencies, make them optional, or make them part of a dependency group.\nUpdating dependencies\nIn long-term projects, it is common to update the packages you are using to bring the most up-to-date features to the table. Or sometimes, a package you are using introduces breaking changes and you want to ensure that version doesn't get installed accidentally in your environment. The add command can be used again in these and any other scenario where you need to change the constraints or versions of existing dependencies.\n1. Installing the latest version of a package:\n$ uv add requests\n2. Installing a specific version:\n$ uv add requests=2.1.2\n3. Change the bounds of a package's constraints:\n$ uv add 'requests<3.0.0'\n4. Make a dependency platform-specific:\n$ uv add 'requests; sys_platform=\"linux\"' \nAdding optional dependencies\nOptional dependencies are packages that are not required for the core functionality of your project but may be needed for specific features. For example, Pandas has an excel extra and a plot extra to avoid the installation of Excel parsers and matplotlib unless someone explicitly requires them. Optionals are usually installed with the pip install pandas[plot, excel] syntax. \nWith UV, this syntax is slightly different. First, ensure that the core Pandas package is installed:\n$ uv add pandas\nThen, add its optional dependencies:\n$ uv add pandas --optional plot excel\nOnce they are resolved, they will be listed in your pyproject.toml with the following format:\n[project]\nname = \"explore-uv\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"Add your description here\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \">=3.9\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"pandas>=2.2.3\",\n    \"requests>=2.32.3\",\n]\n[project.optional-dependencies]\nplot = [\n    \"excel>=1.0.1\",\n    ...\n]\nDependency groups\nDependency groups allow you to organize your dependencies into logical groups, such as development dependencies, test dependencies, or documentation dependencies. This is useful for keeping your production dependencies separate from your development dependencies.\nTo add a dependency to a specific group, use the --group flag:\n$ uv add --group group_name package_name\nThen, users will be able to control which groups to install using the --group, --only-group, and --no-group tags.\nSwitching From PIP and Virtualenv to UV\nMigrating from PIP and virtualenv to UV is straightforward since UV maintains compatibility with existing Python packaging standards. Here's a step-by-step guide to make the transition smooth:\n1. Converting an existing virtualenv project\nIf you have an existing project using virtualenv and pip, start by generating a requirements.txt file from your current environment if you haven't already:\n$ pip freeze > requirements.txt\nThen, create a new UV project in the same directory:\n$ uv init .\nFinally, install the dependencies from your requirements file:\n$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n2. Replacing common pip/virtualenv commands\nHere's a quick reference for replacing common pip and virtualenv commands with their UV equivalents:\n\n\n\n\n\npip/virtualenv command\n\n\nUV equivalent\n\n\n\n\npython -m venv .venv\n\n\nuv venv\n\n\n\n\npip install package\n\n\nuv add package\n\n\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nuv pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\npip uninstall package\n\n\nuv remove package\n\n\n\n\npip freeze\n\n\nuv pip freeze\n\n\n\n\npip list",

    "text": "pip/virtualenv command\n\n\nUV equivalent\n\n\n\n\npython -m venv .venv\n\n\nuv venv\n\n\n\n\npip install package\n\n\nuv add package\n\n\n\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nuv pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\npip uninstall package\n\n\nuv remove package\n\n\n\n\npip freeze\n\n\nuv pip freeze\n\n\n\n\npip list\n\n\nuv pip list\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter migration, you can safely remove your old virtualenv directory and start using UV's virtual environment management. The transition is typically seamless, and you can always fall back to pip commands through UV's pip compatibility layer if needed.\nConclusion\nUV represents a significant advancement in Python package management, offering a modern, fast, and efficient alternative to traditional tools. Its key advantages include:\n\nBlazing fast performance with 10-100x speed improvements over pip\nSeamless integration with existing Python packaging standards\nBuilt-in virtual environment management\nEfficient dependency resolution and lock file support\nLow memory footprint and resource usage\n\nWhether you're starting a new project or migrating an existing one, UV provides a robust solution that can significantly improve your Python development workflow.
